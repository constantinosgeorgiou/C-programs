# C-programs

This Repo contains some of the most common programs we do with the [C Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))  
You can compile these using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any other C compiler and then run the compiled code.
You can also use [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) to achieve the same.

Commands to run (for GCC) are:  
`gcc file.c` To get compiled output as `a.out` or you can specify output file with -o flag like `gcc file.c -o file`
Then just run the compiled file following your OS methods.
